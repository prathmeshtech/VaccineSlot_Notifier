# VaccineSlot_Notifier
This Project is made to simplify the process of vaccine booking. To make it to our fingertips, vaccine availability notification will be pushed on to our telegram group by a telegram bot.

-We have used cowin API of calendarByDistrict which is publicly available on "apisetu.gov.in" site.

-Later the data in  JSON format is trimmed to take  only required information.

LATER MODIFICATION: 
We switched on to another cowin API of (findByPin) to give more precised data to the user.
